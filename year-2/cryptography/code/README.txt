-=notes=-
- all tools use modular 26
- the decrypt with an unknwon key tool takes some time as it has to run through a load of possablitites
- recomended using python idle (3.10.2) 
- some of the more specific words in other groups might not be in the dictionary but we have tried to add as many as possible
- the bruteforce tool should be able to crack most ciphertexted given as long as it contains real english words


-=instructions=-
- open the files using python idle 3.10.2
- press F5 to run the code 
- follow instruction on the idle terminal
- any issues please contact
